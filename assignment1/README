Program will be simple due to me getting used to c++ again.

Marbles will be represented as an array, using 2 different strings within.
One shall be color, with choice of red, green, and yellow.
Second will be size, with small medium or large.

These can be randomized or customized by the user.
The user can choose a random amount of marbles to populate the bag.
The user can choose a specific type of marble to populate the bag.
The attributes of the marbles will be tracked.

The user may also choose to pull out a marble
This will remove a marble and display its qualities

The program will have a main array that will represent the bag
a random number generater will select a random marble to be pulled out
the user can also retrieve the last marble added to the bag



-----------TESTING------------

adding up to 100000 marbles 
*this will be the maximum amount of marbles allowed in the bag

adding negative amounts of marbles
*negative amounts will be refused

removing negative amounts of marbles
*negative amounts will be refused

entering a character where there should be an integer
*will be refused

entering a float where there should be an integer
